## W24VariantTable

To make life more interesting, some Technical Drawings contain a seperate specification table that typically looks something like this:

|        | length | width      |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Type A | 10     | 10 +/- 0.1 |
| Type B | 10     | 12 +/- 0.2 |

A Sheet that contains such a specification table consequently describes multiple W24Variants; in this case the parts "Type A" and "Type B".

!!! Note

    Please get in touch if you are interested in obtaining this information through the API.

## W24Variant

Each sheet may describe one or more Variants, depending on the precense of a [W24VariantTable](#w24variantable). You can think of it as a different term for a Part. In most cases a Technical Drawing will only describe one Variant (i.e., one Part), but we see W24VariantTables in about 2-5% of the files. So be sure to implement the handling of multiple variants.
