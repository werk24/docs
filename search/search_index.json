Communication Flow \u00b6 To make things a bit clearer, have a quick look at the sequence diagram below that describes a communication flow in which you are asking the W24 Techread API for two things: W24AskPageThumbnail: A Thumbnail of the Page W24AskVariantOverallDimensions: the overall dimensions of all the variants described on the page. sequenceDiagram participant You participant W24 Https participant W24 Websocket participant AWS Cognito rect rgb(200,200,200) Note over You, W24 Https: Authenticate You->>AWS Cognito: Authenticate AWS Cognito -->>You: Token end rect rgb(200,200,200) Note over You, W24 Https: Initiate Request with 2 Asks: -> W24AskPageThumbnail, -> W24AskVariantOverallDimensions You->>W24 Websocket: Initiate Request with Asks W24 Websocket -->>You: RequestId You->>W24 Https: Upload Drawing You->>W24 Websocket: Start Read Process end rect rgb(200,200,200) Note over You, W24 Https: Response for W24AskPageThumbnail W24 Websocket -->>You: Response You ->> W24 Https: Request `payload_url` W24 Https -->> You: Thumbnail as PNG end rect rgb(200,200,200) Note over You, W24 Https: Response for W24AskVariantOverallDimensions W24 Websocket -->>You: Response end Rational \u00b6 We have decided to use this (rather unusual) format for two main reasons: 1. Continuous Information Flow \u00b6 We want to ensure that you can consume the information whenever it becomes available. So rather than waiting for the complete process to complete (which can take up to 1 minute), you can quickly get the information you need. 2. Continuous Extendability \u00b6 We are constantly learning new things about your use cases and the particularities of the Technical Drawings that you submit (thank you oil and gas... we are having a lot of fun reading about your fanzy standards). This makes it important for us to quickly and easily extend the API capabilities without the need to maintain \"legacy APIs\". The chosen form allows us to continuously extend the functionality of the API while maintaining backwards-compatability. An easy example are the units in W24AskVariantOverallDimensions. Currently we quote the measures \"as-is\" from the Technical Drawing. So, if you submit two otherwise identical drawings, but change the units in one from Milimeter to Inches, you will currently receive the same response. This is clearly not desired and will be improved in the future. When we do, we'll add an attribute to the W24AskVariantOverallDimensions that allows you to choose the behaviour. By default it will mimick the old behaviour. Important We urge you to follow the Best Practices on Integration Testing. Check this Article for example.

It is actively maintained and will be the lead-implementation for all our development efforts. Initiating the Client \u00b6 You can make a new Techread client in two lines of code. from werk24 import W24TechreadClient client = W24TechreadClient.make_from_env() This will create a new client from the environment variables. The client will look for the credentials in the .werk24 file in your working directory. If the file cannot be found, the Client falls back to the information it can obtain from the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES . The Ask Concept \u00b6 We understand that the individual use-cases can vary largely. Take these two extremes: Application 1 runs a batch job to obtain thumbnails of the main sectional on a Technical Drawing. Application 2 wants to derive the minimal tolerances on an A0 Technical drawing to inform the live-pricing engine. The user remains online and wants to be entertained while she is waiting for the price assessment. To serve both applications with the same API, we have introduced the concept \"Ask\", which allows you to define very precicely what you want to learn about the Technical Drawing. Each \"Ask\" then triggers a response as soon as the information becomes available. To come back to our application: Applciation 1 would submit only one Ask: W24AskSectionalThumbnail() Application 2 would submit multiple Asks W24AskSheetThumbnail() -- gives the user an overview over the complete sheet W24AskSectionalThumbail() -- shows to the user that the individual sectionals have been separated correctly W24AskVariantMeasures() -- delivers the complete information about the Measures (incl. tolerances) See API/Asks for details. Defining Hooks \u00b6 To make your life as developer as easy as possible, we introduced a small Hook object that allows you to define The Ask, and What function should be called when the Ask is answered The defintion is very simple: from werk24 import Hook,W24AskVariantMeasures hooks = [Hook(ask=W24AskVariantMeasures(), function=print)] For a full list of available asks, refer to API/Asks Submitting a Request \u00b6 Submitting a request requires you to start a session and submit both, a Technical Drawing (as bytes) and a list of hooks drawing_path = ... drawing_bytes = open(drawing_path, \"rb\").read() async with client as session session.read_drawing_with_hooks( drawing_bytes, hooks) !!! important Be sure to call the sniplet asyncinously (see Full Example) Full Example \u00b6 Combining all parts from above, we arrive at the full example. When you call the script with the path to a Technical Drawing as first argument, you should shortly after see the measures that were detected on the Drawing. Be aware that the API will return a response for each sectional that was found on the Canvas. If your Document contains 2 Pages with 2 Sectionals each, you will receive 4 responses. import asyncio import sys from dotenv import load_dotenv from werk24 import W24TechreadClient, W24AskVariantMeasures, Hook load_dotenv('.werk24') async def main(drawing_path:str) -> None: # define the hooks hooks = [Hook(ask=W24AskVariantMeasures(), function=print)] # make the session and start the reading process client = W24TechreadClient.make_from_env() async with client as session: await session.read_drawing_with_hooks(drawing_bytes, hooks) if __name__ == \"__main__\": try: drawing_path = sys.argv[1] # get the drawing with open(drawing_path, \"rb\") as drawing_handle: drawing_bytes = drawing_handle.read() except FileNotFoundError: sys.exit(\"File not found\") except KeyError: sys.exit(\"Drawing Path Required as first argument\") asyncio.run(main(drawing_path)) Further Pointers \u00b6 In case you plan to implement your own client, have a look at the structure of the Python client.
